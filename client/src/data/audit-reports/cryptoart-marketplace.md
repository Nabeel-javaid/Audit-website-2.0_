# CryptoArt Marketplace Security Audit

**Audit Date:** April 2023  
**Status:** Issues Found & Resolved ⚠️✅  
**Audit ID:** NFT-002

## Executive Summary

This report details the findings from a security audit of the CryptoArt Marketplace smart contracts. The audit investigated potential security vulnerabilities, gas optimization issues, and compliance with NFT and smart contract standards.

The CryptoArt Marketplace is designed to facilitate the creation, buying, selling, and trading of digital artwork as NFTs, with a focus on artist royalty distribution.

## Scope

The following smart contracts were in scope for this audit:

```

├── Marketplace.sol
├── NFTFactory.sol
├── RoyaltyDistributor.sol
├── interfaces/
│   ├── IMarketplace.sol
│   ├── INFTFactory.sol
│   └── IRoyaltyDistributor.sol
└── libraries/
    ├── MarketplaceLogic.sol
    └── RoyaltyCalculator.sol
```

## Key Findings

### Critical Issues

#### C-1: Royalty Bypass in Secondary Sales

**Description:**  
A critical vulnerability in the `executeSale` function allowed buyers and sellers to bypass royalty payments on secondary sales by manipulating the price reporting mechanism.

**Recommendation:**  
Implement an immutable royalty fee structure tied to the NFT metadata and enforce it at the contract level using EIP-2981.

**Resolution:**  
Fixed. The team implemented EIP-2981 for royalty information and updated the marketplace to enforce royalties at the protocol level.

### High Severity Issues

#### H-1: Centralized Token Approval

**Description:**  
The marketplace required users to approve their entire NFT collection to the marketplace contract, creating a single point of failure.

**Recommendation:**  
Implement a per-transaction approval model or upgrade to an EIP-2612 permit-based approach.

**Resolution:**  
Fixed. The marketplace now uses a per-transaction signature validation approach similar to OpenSea's method.

#### H-2: Incorrect Price Calculation for Bundle Sales

**Description:**  
Bundle sales containing multiple NFTs calculated prices incorrectly, potentially resulting in under or overpayment.

**Recommendation:**  
Refactor the price calculation logic to correctly handle bundle sales.

**Resolution:**  
Fixed. The price calculation was refactored and extensive testing was implemented.

### Medium Severity Issues

#### M-1: Front-running Risks in Listing Creation

**Description:**  
Listings could be front-run by monitoring the mempool for new listing transactions.

**Recommendation:**  
Implement a commit-reveal scheme or a minimum listing duration to mitigate front-running.

**Resolution:**  
Partially fixed. A minimum listing duration was implemented, but the team decided against the commit-reveal approach due to UX concerns.

#### M-2: Lack of Access Control Time-locks

**Description:**  
Administrative functions had no time-lock, allowing immediate changes to critical parameters.

**Recommendation:**  
Implement a time-lock mechanism for all administrative actions.

**Resolution:**  
Fixed. A 48-hour time-lock was implemented for all administrative functions.

### Low Severity Issues

Six low severity issues were identified, including:
- Gas optimization opportunities
- Lack of event emissions for critical state changes
- Inconsistent error messages
- Redundant code
- Incomplete documentation

All low severity issues were addressed in the updated codebase.

## Conclusion

The CryptoArt Marketplace demonstrated numerous security issues of varying severity, all of which were addressed during the remediation phase. The development team showed a strong commitment to security by implementing all recommended changes.

After remediation, the marketplace smart contracts demonstrate a high level of security and adherence to best practices. The marketplace now properly enforces royalties, protects users from excessive approvals, and includes properly secured administrative functions.

We recommend ongoing security vigilance as the platform evolves, particularly for new features involving the royalty distribution mechanism.
