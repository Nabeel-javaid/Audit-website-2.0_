# CryptoArt Marketplace Security Audit

**Client:** CryptoArt Marketplace  
**Date:** April 10, 2023  
**Auditor:** Quantum Security  

## Executive Summary

CryptoArt Marketplace is a decentralized platform for trading NFTs with support for creator royalties, bidding mechanisms, and secondary sales. This audit examined the smart contracts that power the platform to identify potential security vulnerabilities.

### Scope

The audit covered the following contracts:
- `NFTMarketplace.sol` - Core marketplace functionality
- `RoyaltyManager.sol` - Creator royalty management and distribution
- `BiddingSystem.sol` - Auction and bidding mechanisms
- `MarketplaceAccessControl.sol` - Administrative control

### Risk Classification

| Severity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Critical | Vulnerabilities that can lead to theft of NFTs, unauthorized transfers, or permanent loss of assets |
| High | Vulnerabilities that can lead to significant financial loss or manipulation of platform mechanisms |
| Medium | Issues that can compromise security under certain conditions or lead to unintended behavior |
| Low | Minor issues, coding standard violations, and best practice recommendations |

## Key Findings

### Critical Severity

No critical severity issues were found.

### High Severity

#### H-01: Incorrect Royalty Distribution

**Description:** The `distributeFees` function in the RoyaltyManager contract incorrectly calculates the royalty split between creators, potentially shorting original creators of their entitled royalties for secondary sales.

**Recommendation:** Fix the royalty calculation algorithm by ensuring that the primary creator receives the correct percentage.

```solidity
// Before
uint256 platformFee = salePrice * platformFeeBps / 10000;
uint256 creatorRoyalty = salePrice * royaltyBps / 10000;
uint256 sellerProceeds = salePrice - platformFee - creatorRoyalty;

// After
uint256 platformFee = salePrice * platformFeeBps / 10000;
uint256 creatorRoyalty = (salePrice - platformFee) * royaltyBps / 10000;
uint256 sellerProceeds = salePrice - platformFee - creatorRoyalty;
```

**Status:** Fixed in commit `d4e5f6g7`

### Medium Severity

#### M-01: Lack of Input Validation in Bid Placement

**Description:** The `placeBid` function does not validate that the bid amount is greater than the current highest bid by a minimum percentage, which could lead to "bid sniping" with minimal increments.

**Recommendation:** Implement a minimum bid increment requirement:

```solidity
function placeBid(uint256 tokenId) external payable {
    Auction storage auction = auctions[tokenId];
    require(block.timestamp < auction.endTime, "Auction ended");
    require(msg.value > auction.highestBid, "Bid too low");
    
    // Add minimum increment check
    uint256 minIncrement = auction.highestBid * 5 / 100; // 5% minimum increment
    require(msg.value >= auction.highestBid + minIncrement, "Bid increment too small");
    
    // Refund previous highest bidder
    if (auction.highestBidder != address(0)) {
        payable(auction.highestBidder).transfer(auction.highestBid);
    }
    
    // Update auction state
    auction.highestBid = msg.value;
    auction.highestBidder = msg.sender;
    
    emit NewBid(tokenId, msg.sender, msg.value);
}
```

**Status:** Fixed in commit `h8i9j0k1`

#### M-02: Missing Deadline Checks for Transactions

**Description:** Marketplace operations do not include a deadline parameter, which could lead to transactions being executed at unfavorable times if they remain pending in the mempool for an extended period.

**Recommendation:** Add a deadline parameter to functions that involve asset transfers or sales.

```solidity
function sellNFT(
    address nftContract,
    uint256 tokenId,
    uint256 price,
    uint256 deadline
) external {
    require(block.timestamp <= deadline, "Transaction expired");
    // Existing code...
}
```

**Status:** Fixed in commit `l2m3n4o5`

### Low Severity

#### L-01: Lack of Event Emissions for State Changes

**Description:** Several functions that modify the state of the contract do not emit events, making it difficult to track changes and monitor the marketplace activity.

**Recommendation:** Add event emissions for all functions that modify the state.

#### L-02: Inconsistent Error Messages

**Description:** Error messages are inconsistent across the codebase, making it difficult to debug issues.

**Recommendation:** Standardize error messages and ensure they provide clear information about the reason for the failure.

#### L-03: Gas Optimization Opportunities

**Description:** Several loops and data structures could be optimized to reduce gas costs.

**Recommendation:** Consider implementing gas optimizations such as using mappings instead of arrays for lookups and avoiding unnecessary storage reads/writes.

## Conclusion

The CryptoArt Marketplace demonstrates a well-designed NFT trading platform with several innovative features. While no critical vulnerabilities were identified, we found one high severity issue related to royalty distribution and two medium severity issues that could impact user experience and economic fairness on the platform. All identified issues have been addressed by the development team, and the final review confirms that the marketplace is now ready for public deployment.

## Appendix

### A1: Testing Methodology

The audit included:
- Manual code review
- Automated analysis using static analysis tools
- Dynamic testing with real NFT transfers on a testnet
- Formal verification of critical functions
- Economic simulations for royalty calculations

### A2: Royalty Distribution Mechanism

The CryptoArt Marketplace implements EIP-2981 for NFT royalty handling, allowing creators to receive a percentage of all secondary sales. Additionally, the platform has extended this standard to support multiple creators with different royalty splits, which is an advanced feature not commonly found in NFT marketplaces.
